# Project Brief

Professional Development refers to the actions and endeavours undertaken to apply acquired knowledge to a specific industry, occupation, or work environment. During the course of this trimester, you will engage in various activities designed to enhance both technical proficiency and writing aptitude. These activities may include assignments given by your facilitator or self-directed projects. Maintaining thorough documentation of the work process serves as an effective means of demonstrating critical thinking and research capabilities. This project serves as an opportunity for you to document your participation in these tasks and your outcomes to be factored into your final holistic grade.

# Project Goals

### You will complete:

- A comprehensive and detailed Learning Journal page that serves as documentation of the process and results of various creative, technical, and academic tasks throughout the trimester, providing evidence of participation and progress;
-  Mid-Trimester Individual Performance and Aspirations Review;
- Use campus showcase to exhibit works created throughout the trimester;
- Project Reflections: Aspirational Reflection & Project Completion
